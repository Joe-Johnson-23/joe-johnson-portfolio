# Chaos Art

A double pendulum visualization project.

## Live Demo
Visit the live application: [Joe Johnson Portfolio](https://joe-johnson-23.github.io/joe-johnson-portfolio/)

## Hidden Keyboard Controls for Infinite Spiral
- `H` - Hides the pendulum's intermediate and terminal points
- `J` - Sends the pivot point of the pendulum to the top left corner
- `K` - Reverses the direction of the pendulum's trails

These keyboard shortcuts allow you to show/hide different UI elements of the application.

## Overview

This project explores the fascinating world of chaos theory through the lens of double pendulum motion. By visualizing the paths traced by multiple pendulums, it creates unique, never-repeating patterns that demonstrate the beauty of mathematical chaos.

## Features

- Real-time double pendulum physics simulation
- Interactive controls for pendulum parameters
- Multiple visualization modes:
  - Prism mode for colorful trail effects
  - Freefall gravity mode
  - Hidden pendulum mode ('h' key)
- Adjustable gravity and vacuum conditions
- Dynamic trail effects

## Technologies Used

- React
- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript Physics Engine
- Vite
